  summary:
    "This is my Rust learning log — one day, one folder, one post. I come from a C++ / Python / quant background ([more about me](https://roddy95o.com)), and every post here reflects on what Rust does differently from C++: ownership vs manual memory management, cargo vs CMake, traits vs templates. All code lives in [RoddyH17/rust_learn](https://github.com/RoddyH17/rust_learn) — each `dayN/` folder is a runnable crate, each blog post is a plain MDX file anyone (including future me) can edit.",
